- Recommend additional academic foundations

### 2. Validation Studies
- Share empirical validation results
- Report correlation studies between SHEEP scores and actual AI recommendation rates
- Provide A/B testing case studies
- Submit longitudinal tracking data

### 3. Case Studies
- Document real-world applications
- Share optimization success stories
- Report unexpected findings or edge cases
- Contribute industry-specific insights

### 4. Localization
- Propose adaptations for other languages
- Suggest regional AI ecosystem variations
