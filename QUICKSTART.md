# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get started with the SHEEP-GEO framework in 10 minutes.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before using SHEEP-GEO, you should have:
- ‚úÖ A website or content platform to assess
- ‚úÖ Basic understanding of SEO concepts
- ‚úÖ Willingness to implement data-driven optimizations

**No coding skills required** - this framework is for strategic guidance.

---

## üéØ Step 1: Understand Your Baseline

### The Five Dimensions

Ask yourself these questions:

#### S - Semantic Coverage
> "Can AI models recognize and understand my content?"

**Quick Test**:
- Open ChatGPT or Claude
- Ask: "What do you know about [https://www.sheepgeo.com](https://www.sheepgeo.com)?"
- Result: Do they know you exist? Is the info accurate?

#### H - Human Credibility
> "Would a human trust my site?"

**Quick Check**:
- [ ] Clear author/team information with credentials?
- [ ] Verifiable data sources cited?
- [ ] Customer reviews/testimonials displayed?
- [ ] Clear privacy policy and terms?

#### E - Evidence Structuring
> "Is my content AI-readable?"

**Quick Scan**:
- [ ] Content uses clear headings and subheadings?
- [ ] Data presented in tables (not paragraphs)?
- [ ] Code examples have syntax highlighting?
- [ ] Technical terms clearly defined?

#### E - Ecosystem Integration
> "Am I visible across multiple platforms?"

**Quick Audit**:
- [ ] Present on GitHub/GitLab?
- [ ] Active on Stack Overflow/Reddit?
- [ ] Articles on Medium/Dev.to?
- [ ] Listed in curated awesome-lists?

#### P - Performance Monitoring
> "Does my site convert visitors from AI referrals?"

**Quick Metrics**:
- [ ] Page loads under 2.5 seconds?
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design?
- [ ] Clear call-to-action buttons?
- [ ] Easy navigation structure?

---

## üìä Step 2: Self-Assessment

Give yourself a score (0-100) for each dimension based on the questions above:

| Dimension | My Score | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| S - Semantic | __/100 | |
| H - Credibility | __/100 | |
| E - Structuring | __/100 | |
| E - Ecosystem | __/100 | |
| P - Performance | __/100 | |

**Calculate Your GEM Score**:
```
GEM = (S √ó 0.25) + (H √ó 0.25) + (E √ó 0.20) + (E √ó 0.15) + (P √ó 0.15)
```

### What's Your Grade?

- **90-100 (A+)**: Excellent! Focus on maintaining and refining
- **80-89 (A)**: Strong foundation, optimize weak spots
- **70-79 (B+)**: Good start, significant improvement opportunity
- **60-69 (B)**: Needs work, prioritize low-hanging fruit
- **<60 (C/D)**: Major opportunity - start with Quick Wins below

---

## ‚ö° Step 3: Quick Wins (Week 1)

Choose 2-3 quick wins based on your weakest dimensions:

### For Low S (Semantic Coverage)

**Action**: Add Schema.org markup (2 hours)

```html
<!-- Add to your homepage -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company Name",
  "description": "One sentence description of what you do",
  "url": "https://yourwebsite.com",
  "logo": "https://yourwebsite.com/logo.png",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://github.com/yourcompany",
    "https://twitter.com/yourcompany"
  ]
}
</script>
```

**Expected Impact**: +5-10 points on S dimension

### For Low H (Credibility)

**Action**: Add comprehensive About page (1 hour)

Include:
- [ ] Team member names, roles, and credentials
- [ ] Company history and mission
- [ ] Verifiable achievements (awards, certifications)
- [ ] Links to social proof (LinkedIn, GitHub)
- [ ] Contact information

**Expected Impact**: +8-12 points on H dimension

### For Low E (Structuring)

**Action**: Restructure one key article (2 hours)

Transform this:
```
We improved performance significantly through various optimizations.
Our response time got much faster and users are happier.
```

Into this:
```
## Performance Optimization Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Response Time | 250ms | 80ms | 68% faster |
| User Satisfaction | 6.2/10 | 8.9/10 | +43% |

**Test Environment**: AWS EC2 t3.medium, 100 concurrent users
**Measurement Tool**: Apache Bench
**Date**: January 15, 2025
```

**Expected Impact**: +6-10 points on E dimension

### For Low E (Ecosystem)

**Action**: Create cross-platform presence (3 hours)

Day 1:
- [ ] Create GitHub account if needed
- [ ] Add your project/profile to relevant Awesome lists
- [ ] Answer 3 questions on Stack Overflow related to your expertise

Day 2:
- [ ] Write one article on Dev.to/Medium linking to your site
- [ ] Comment on 5 relevant discussions in your niche

**Expected Impact**: +5-8 points on E dimension (compounding over time)

### For Low P (Performance)

**Action**: Performance optimization sprint (4 hours)

Priority fixes:
1. Enable Gzip/Brotli compression
2. Optimize images (use WebP, lazy loading)
3. Add clear CTA buttons on key pages
4. Test mobile responsiveness

Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to measure.

**Expected Impact**: +8-15 points on P dimension

---

## üéØ Step 4: Test AI Recognition

After implementing quick wins, test if AI can find you:

### Manual Testing

**Test 1: Recognition**
- Ask ChatGPT: "What is [your company/project]?"
- Ask Claude: "Tell me about [https://www.sheepgeo.com](https://www.sheepgeo.com)"
- Ask Perplexity: "Explain what [your brand] does"

**Test 2: Recommendation**
- Ask: "Recommend tools for [your use case]"
- See if AI mentions you (or competitors)

**Test 3: Citation**
- Ask: "How do I [problem your site solves]?"
- Check if AI cites your content in answer

### Document Results

| AI Model | Recognized? | Accurate? | Cited? |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| ChatGPT | ‚òê | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| Claude | ‚òê | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| Perplexity | ‚òê | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| Gemini | ‚òê | ‚òê | ‚òê |

**Improvement Goal**: Recognition by 7+ / 10 models within 3 months

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### "How long until I see results?"

**Quick wins (1-2 weeks)**: Improved site structure, better schema markup
**Medium term (1-3 months)**: AI recognition improvements
**Long term (3-6 months)**: Measurable traffic increase from AI referrals

### "Which dimension should I prioritize?"

Focus on your **lowest-scoring dimension** first - that's where you'll see the biggest ROI. After bringing all dimensions above 60, then optimize strategically.

### "Do I need technical skills?"

**No** for most optimizations (content restructuring, schema markup, authority building)
**Yes** for advanced performance optimization (may need developer help)

### "How do I track GEO traffic?"

Look for these in Google Analytics:
- Referrals from AI platforms (chat.openai.com, claude.ai, etc.)
- Direct traffic spikes (users copying URLs from AI responses)
- Branded search increases (AI mentions drive curiosity)

### "Is this different from SEO?"

**Yes**. SEO optimizes for search engines, GEO optimizes for AI models. Many tactics overlap, but GEO emphasizes:
- Semantic clarity over keyword density
- Verifiable data over general claims
- Cross-platform authority over backlinks
- Structured content over length
